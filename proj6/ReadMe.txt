PROJECT TITLE: Greedy Scheduler
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To fit the maximum number of classes between 
the times 8:00 and 17:00.
VERSION or DATE: 12/10/11
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Feed the class starting times and end times
into the program from the input file. Find the earliest end time of a 
class that starts after 8:00. Set beginning time of 
8AM to end time of assigned class. Find the next earliest end of class
period that ends before 17:00 and starts after new beginning time.
Keep doing using this method until all the potential classes 
are used or there are no more classes that end before 17:00 and
start after current previous classes end time.
